# Filetrans

Filetrans is a multi-platform, convenient file transporter under the same network environment.

Our app is under the GPLv3 license.  
You can view that license in the License part on the top right.

It's an app that uses the 192.168.*.* or 10.100.*.* internal IP address to transfer between PCs.  
It's simple and efficient.

We are now launching the v0.1.0. It's the first version of our system.
The whole development lasted for approx. 1 day only.
So, expect bugs in our app.
You can open an issue to report the bug to us.
Thank you all.

But, it can't be launched on Windows(R) XP.  
If you have an issue, please launch it.  
For the result, open an issue and we'll reply as quickly as we can.
