# Filetrans
----------
Filetrans is a multi-platform, convenient file transporter under the same network environment.

Our app is under the BSD3 license.
You can view that license in the License part on the top.

It's an app that uses the 192.168 internal IP address to transfer between internal PCs.
It's simple and efficient.

We are now launching the v0.1.0. It's the first version of our system.
The whole development lasted for approx. 1 day only.
So, expect bugs in our app.
You can open an issue to report the bug to us.
Thank you all.

-----------
This app can be perfectly launched on Microsoft Windows(R) 10, 8.1, 8, 7.
For Windows(R) XP, we can't find a device running Windows(R) XP in our team. So, if you have one, please test it for us.
For the result, open an issue and we'll reply as quickly as we can.
Thank you very much.
